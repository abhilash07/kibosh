# Kibosh

A generic broker bridging the gap between Kubernetes and CF brokered services.

## Dev
#### Setup
Grab a newish version of Go (we used 1.9) 

Install Go depenencies
```bash
go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get github.com/onsi/gomega
go get github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter
```

#### Dependency vendoring
Dependency management is kind of a horror show here. For background, see
* https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/INSTALL.md
* https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/83

To vendor a new helm version:
* Cleanup existing k8s libraries from gopath
* Make sure your *don't* have other k8s repos (especially `client-go`) checked out or you'll likely run into conflicts
    - remove all `$GOPATH/src/k8s.io`
* Checkout helm (`go get k8s.io/helm`) and jump through the hoops to get it to compile
    - `make bootstrap` (this does a glide install strip vendor and deletes/moves several libraries)
* Swear a few times & then cross fingers
* Import deps
    - `govendor add +external`

To change dependencies, see [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) docs for specific commands.

(Tried `dep`, but it added 10s of megabytes of golang.org/x/... to vendor)

#### Test
```bash
make test
```

#### Run
```bash
make run
```
